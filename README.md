# AdventureAwaits
ChatGPT Prompts for adventure-style games.


## Getting Started

1) Drag-and-drop the base prompt and the template files into ChatGPT
2) Type 'CREATE ADEVNTURE" to define your adventure
3) Type "CREATE CHARACTER" to define your character(s)
4) Adventure!

## Exporting an adventure

The process started by "CREATE ADVENTURE" should output the adventure definition
in the format of the template.  Copy-paste this into a file to save if you think 
it works for others. If it doesn't export, you can ask ChatGPT to "print the 
adventure in the format of adventure_template.md in a way I can copy".

Similar for characters.

## Importing and adventure and character(s)

If you have a file for an adventure, you can upload that to ChatGPT
instead of running the CREATE ADVENTURE flow.
